## 📌 What am I?

Nodeactyl is a Library for node.js to communicate with the Pterodactyl Panel. You can control any server on your nodes with it (If you purchase a server from another host, no worry! The API works with your own server too!). This library's originally was to be used in Discord bots, however it can be used in any node.js project.

---

## ❓ How do I work?

This library works by querying the Pterodactyl API \(REST requests\) using a library called [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios).

---

## 💻 Getting started with installation

```bash
npm i nodeactyl
```

---

## 📖 Documentation (coming soon)

The full documentation will be released once its finished and everything is documented.

It is **_NOT_** our fault if your API key is revealed to the public.
